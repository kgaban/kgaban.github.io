						<h3> 2/2/18 </h3>
						<p>This is the first post on my *new* blog!  It's been a while since I've done this... I used to have a bunch of blog posts on my old website,
							but I didn't feel like paying for the domain name this year haha.  I actually like the setup of GitHub Pages though, so hopefully I can get back to posting regularly.
							Where do we start?  It's 11:10pm on Friday night and all I can think about is how little time I have before graduation.  Sure there's still a lot of work to do in between,
							but these next few months are going to go quick.  The theme of this post is going to be about <strong>motivation</strong>.</p>
						<p>Wow, how original am I right? No seriously, sometimes you just need to... do something.  It's so easy to just waste time especially with the Internet at our disposal.
							 It's a double-edged sword though.  We live in the age of infinite knowledge.  That means you can learn anything you want, whenever you want.  You just have to be <strong>motivated</strong>.
						 	 Sometime last year I really wanted to learn how to make music.  Now I don't mean playing instruments (which I definitely do want to learn) but I wanted to learn how to make music on a Computer.
						 	 I am a CS major after all.  I was <strong>motivated</strong> after I heard that the song Rockstar by Post Malone had the beat made by a college student.  That song was #1 for how many weeks?
						 	 It's crazy because well, anyone can do it (infinite knowledge remember?)  So I figured, why not me?  I downloaded FL Studio 12 and got to it.  I sucked bad when I started.  Arguably I still do
							 haha. But it's fun and it's interesting to see how when you break down certain songs you can see all the different pieces working together.  Whenever I hear new songs, I can't help but think about
						   how I would create it on my computer.  Note to self: Seriously, invest in the <a href="http://a.co/gI8L4s6">MIDI keyboard</a> you've been looking at for months.</p>
